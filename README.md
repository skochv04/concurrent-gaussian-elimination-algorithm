# Ð¡oncurrent Gaussian Elimination Algorithm
An implementation of the concurrent Gaussian elimination algorithm, developed as part of the Concurrency Theory course at AGH University of Science and Technology. This project also applies the theory of traces for thread scheduling in the concurrent Gaussian elimination process.

The task involves the following steps (for a matrix of size N):
- Identify indivisible tasks in the algorithm, name them, and construct an alphabet in terms of trace theory.
- Construct a dependency relation for the alphabet describing the Gaussian elimination algorithm.
- Represent the Gaussian elimination algorithm as a sequence of alphabet symbols.
- Generate the Diekert dependency graph.
- Convert the sequence of symbols describing the algorithm to its Foata normal form.

For a detailed report on the implementation and the steps taken, please refer to the [report.pdf](task/report.pdf).
